Wolverine Standalone Checkers

This will contain standalone commands/batch/powershell/bash scripts/registry updates etc...

====WARNING====
NEVER, EVER, RUN A SCRIPT, POWERSHELL, BATCH FILE, EXE, OR PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING - WITHOUT CHECKING IT AND UNDERSTANDING IT FIRST!

====ESPECIALLY AS ADMIN====

We know FOR A FACT - that some of the output we receive, is simply incomplete, or in some cases potentially pure lies.

This is what is being delivered by the Operating System / Provider - and the best we can provide, and will provide in some cases (until they lock it down) more information than you would see otherwise.

There are methods to work around and determine these, with much more complexity...this is not done here, trust nobody!

Scripts are verified and checked best we can, but are specific, and not tested widely across multiple version/OS.

If I was you, I would not trust us, we trust nobody, and we would be very careful running ANYTHING! Anything here "should" be relatively safe. However I'd trust that statement like I trust the likes of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and our Governements.

Any inputs these scripts take will be based on files, not from the W0lv3r1ne/Adamantium Database, they could be out of date, they could be wrong, they could have been amended, or due to the state of OS changes, they could no longer be valid...

We attempt to have obvious warnings and checkpoints requiring user input to confirm any changes or concerns, or where elevation needed.

If making any changes you are advised to back up and create restore points, backup registry or target, or run it in a VM first!

These are sub-sets of W0lv3r1ne/Adamantium and designed for investigation or quick fixes...but they are early standalone versions, without the checksums and validation used by W0lv3r1ne/Adamantium/First Recon/Grey Area/Firewall X
